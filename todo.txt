Test Workflow Implementation Checklist:

1. Basic Build and Test Workflow (test-build.yml)
   - [x] Build container
   - [x] Run basic tests
   - [x] Run integration tests
   Status: Created, needs testing

2. Local Kubernetes Test Workflow (test-k8s-local.yml)
   - [x] Spin up local K8s cluster using KinD
   - [x] Deploy SFTP Worker inside cluster
   - [x] Run tests against local deployment
   Status: Created, needs testing

3. Remote Kubernetes Test Workflow (test-k8s-remote.yml)
   - [x] Connect to remote K8s cluster
   - [x] Deploy SFTP Worker
   - [x] Run tests against remote deployment
   Status: Created, needs testing

4. GCP Deployment Workflow (deploy-gcp.yml)

Next Steps:
- Implement and test each workflow
- Verify cross-cluster connectivity
- Test AKS/non-AKS configurations
- Update documentation with workflow details
