Test Workflow Implementation Checklist:

1. Basic Build and Test Workflow (test-build.yml)
   - [x] Build container
   - [x] Run basic tests
   - [x] Run integration tests
   - [x] Fix Dockerfile architecture issues
   - [x] Remove unnecessary dependencies
   Status: Working

2. Local Kubernetes Test Workflow (test-k8s-local.yml)
   - [x] Spin up local K8s cluster using KinD
   - [x] Deploy SFTP Worker inside cluster
   - [x] Run tests against local deployment
   Status: Created, needs testing

3. Remote Kubernetes Test Workflow (test-k8s-remote.yml)
   - [x] Connect to remote K8s cluster
   - [x] Deploy SFTP Worker
   - [x] Run tests against remote deployment
   Status: Created, needs testing

4. GCP Deployment Workflow (deploy-gcp.yml)
   - [ ] Build and push to Google Container Registry
   - [ ] Deploy as standalone container
   - [ ] Connect to Kubernetes engine
   - [ ] Verify deployment
   Status: Paused - removed GCP dependencies

Next Steps:
- [x] Fix Docker builds on GitHub Actions
- [x] Optimize container size and dependencies
- [ ] Implement and test each workflow
- [ ] Verify cross-cluster connectivity
- [ ] Test AKS/non-AKS configurations
- [ ] Update documentation with workflow details
- [ ] Add proper error handling in Node.js components
- [ ] Implement proper logging with debug mode
